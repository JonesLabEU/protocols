# Plate reader
## Procedure
1. Turn on CLARIOstar Plus and open the associated program.
2. **Settings** within a protocol (right click to edit):
	1. **Measurement interval** – how often you make measurements, e.g. 300 s means every 5 min.
	2. **Duration** – how long you want to run the protocol
	3. **Number of measurements** – how many measurements to make at each time point
	4. **Measurement pattern** – spiral (mostly a personal preference)
2. Settings in the program:
	1. **Temperature: 37C, on**
3. Plate preparation:
	2. Use **flat bottom** 96-well plates; round-bottoms might scatter the light
	3. Use a **lid** so that your culture does not evaporate. For long measurement sessions, coat the plate's lid with **20% ethanol + .05% Triton X-100** in order to prevent vapor from condensing on the lid and distorting measurements.
	4. Place 100 uL of a blank medium and 100 uL of each of your samples.
	5. Samples should start from OD .05-.1.
4. Insert the plate in the purple tray (click the small purple button on the device or in the program to open and close the tray).
5. Click "Start measurement" in your protocol.
	1. The device start working and most buttons in the program become disabled.
	2. Click on "Current State" to see the data as it is accumulating.
	3. You may pause your run, take out the plate, add something to it, put it back and continue measurements.
	4. You can also stop the run prematurely. It will ask if you want your data saved. Choose "Yes".
6. Open data analysis program and export data to csv.
