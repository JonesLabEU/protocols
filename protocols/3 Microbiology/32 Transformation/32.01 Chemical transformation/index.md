# Chemical transformation
## Overview
Sterile technique must be strictly observed – work next to an open flame.
All centrifuge bottles, tubes, solutions, pipets, etc. must be sterile.
## Materials
- DH5alpha / Top10 of E. coli cells from -80C
- 100 mM CaCl2 (ice cold)
- 100 mM CaCl2 with 15% glycerol
- LB medium
- *(Optional)* Antibiotics
## Procedure
### Chemically competent cell preparation
*Yields about 4 tubes with 50 uL of chemically competent cells.*

1. Prepare **4 mL of overnight** cell culture.
2. Transfer **40 uL** (diluting ratio 1:100) to a fresh tubes with **LB medium** and **antibiotic** (if needed) and incubate shaking at 250 rpm/37ºC for **2-2.5 h** until **OD600 reaches .45-.6**.
	- Monitor growth starting at 2 h.
	- OD600 can go up to .8.
3. **Chill on ice**.
4. Chill centrifuge to 4C.
5. Repeat until all culture has been used up:
	1. Add **1.4 mL culture** into two 1.5 mL microtubes (either fresh or on top of the previous pellet).
	2. Centrifuge at **6000 g** / 4C for **5 min**.
	3. Discard supernatant.
6. **Resuspend** each pellet in .**5 ml ice cold 100 mM CaCl2.**
7. **Centrifuge** at 6000 g / 4C for 5 min and discard supernatant.
8. **Resuspend** each pellet in **.5 ml ice cold 100 mM CaCl2** and **incubate** on ice for at least **30 min**.
9. **Centrifuge** at 6000 g / 4C for 5 min and discard supernatant.
	- Can repeat the previous incubation step once more to get even more competent cells.
10. **Resuspend** the first microtube in 200 uL ice cold **CaCl2:glycerol** solution, then transfer to the second microtube and resuspend the other pellet.
11. Prepare **50 uL** aliquots in sterile microfuge tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.
12. Store in -80ºC freezer and use within 3 months.
### Transformation
1. Prewarm **water bath to 42C.**
2. Prewarm **1 mL SOC** to **37C.**
3. **Thaw** a tube containing 50 uL chemically competent cells on ice for **2-5 min** and **gently flick** to resuspend them.
	- Competent cells are very fragile!
4. Add 10-100 ng of **plasmid DNA** to cells and mix without vortexing.
	- Total plasmid volume should not exceed 1/10 of the cell volume.
	- Choose to add closer to 100 ng of plasmid when competent cells are not fresh.
5. Incubate on ice for **10-30 min**.
	- Longer incubation generally leads to more colonies.
6. Heat shock tubes in water bath **(42C) for 45 sec.**
7. Place **on ice for 3 min.**
8. Add **900 uL prewarmed SOC** and recover in a shaker for 1 h (250 rpm).
9. Proceed to plating.
