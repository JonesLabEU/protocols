# Chemical transformation
## Overview
Sterile technique must be strictly observed – work next to an open flame.
All centrifuge bottles, tubes, solutions, pipets, etc. must be sterile.
## Materials
- DH5alpha / Top10 of E. coli cells – -80C fridge
- 50 mM CaCl2 (ice cold)
- 50 mM CaCl2 with 100% glycerol (86% of CaCl2 and 14% of glycerol)
    - If anhydrous – 5.55 g for 1 L water
    - If monohydrate – 6.45g for 1 L water
    - If dihydrate – 7.35g for 1 L water
- LB media
- Spectrophotometer
- 37°C shaking incubator (200 rpm)
- Ice bucket
## Procedure
### Chemically competent cell preparation
1. Inoculate 1 ml of LB with cells from a frozen glycerol stock and incubate overnight at 37ºC.
2. Transfer the entire 1 ml into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask containing 500 ml LB and incubate at 37ºC.
3. Monitor growth starting at about 2 hours by measuring OD of an aliquot. Let cells grow until the OD550 = 0.45 to 0.6. This should take approximately 4 hours.
4. Transfer the culture to 2 x 500 ml centrifuge bottles and chill on ice to 4ºC.
5. Centrifuge at 6,000 g for 5 min at 4ºC (cool ahead of time).
6. Pour off supernatant and pipette off remaining supernatant.
7. Resuspend each pellet in 125 ml ice cold 50mM CaCl2. Combine into a single 500 ml centrifuge bottle.
8. Centrifuge at 6,000 g for 5 min at 4ºC.
9. Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 21.5 ml ice cold CaCl2:glycerol solution
10. Prepare 500 µl aliquots in sterile microfuge tubes and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen
11. Store in -80ºC freezer. Use within 6 months if possible
### Transformation
1. Prewarm **water bath to 42C.**
2. Prewarm **SOC recovery medium** to **37C.**
3. **Thaw** a tube of electrocompetent cells immerse in ice for **2-5 min** and **gently flick** to resuspend them.
	- Competent cells are very fragile!
4. Add **50 uL cells** to the tube.
5. Add **1 uL** (1 pg-100 ng) of **plasmid DNA** to cells and mix without vortexing.
6. Incubate on ice for **10 min**
7. Heat shock tubes in water bath **(42C) for 45 sec.**
8. Place **on ice for 3 min.**
9. Add **900 uL prewarmed SOC**.
10. Proceed to plating.
