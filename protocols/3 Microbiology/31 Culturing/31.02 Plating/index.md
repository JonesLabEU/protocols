# Plating
## Overview
Done after electroporation or chemical transformation.
## Procedure
 1. Shake at 250 rpm for at least **1 hour at 37°C** to allow the expression of the antibiotic resistance gene. Meanwhile, **prewarm plates** (cover side down) **at 37C for 1 hour**.
	 - If the plates contain a lot of moisture, place them cover side up and open the cover ~1/3 way to allow the plates to dry for 30-45 min.
2. (Optional) To concentrate the cells, spin down for **2 min at 2400 g**, then **remove** **supernatant**.
3. **Resuspend** the cells by a gentle pipetting, then take **5-50 uL**. 
	- Plate less for higher efficiency plasmids and vice versa.
4. Plating:
	1. With a spreader (loop):
		1. Immerse the spreader in ethanol and use flame to sterilize it. Allow 10 s to cool, then touch agar at the edge of a plate (not touching the cells).
		2. Gently touch down the spreader and briefly and evenly spread the cells.
			- Do not continue to spread until the sample has absorbed completely as this is lethal to cells.
			- Rotating the plate might help.
		3. Before inverting the plates, allow the surplus liquid to absorb by leaving the plates on the bench for a few minutes.
	2. With beads: Add 10-20 beads, close the lid and rock the plate a few times.
		- Beads spread cells more evenly and do not require ethanol/flame.
		- This is particularly useful if spreading on multiple plates as you can shake them all at the same time by stacking them together.
5. Incubate at 37C overnight (**cover side down**; 15-18 h).
	- Extend incubation time by 1-2 hours for larger colonies.
	- If performing blue/white screening, place the plates at 4ºC for a few hours after the colonies have reached the desired size to enhance color development.
6. **Store** the remaining transformation mix at **+4°C**. Additional cells may be plated out the next day, if desired.
## Troubleshooting
- Few or no colonies:
	- Test with a known plasmid, e.g., pUC19, if the cells are alive and the protocol is working.
		- If not, check antibiotic choice and its concentration, media formulation and its stock, and incubation temperature.
		- Make sure you're treating cells very gently. NEver vortex or mix vigorously. Resuspend by a gentle flick of gentle pipetting. Always keep them on ice. If thawed, do not place back to -70C as efficency might drop severalfold.
	- Purify DNA form excess salts, EDTA, proteins that may impede vector and insert ligation.
- Small satellite colonies apprear:
	- Plates were incubated for too long. Beta-lactamase is secreted by amp-resistant bacteria and eventually clear a zone around themselves from antibiotic where non-recombinants can grow.
	- Antibiotic degraded (old plates or poured into too hot media)
