# Agar plates
## Overview
Required volumes:
- For a small Petri dish (90 mm): ~20 mL of agar mix
- For a big plate (150 mm): ~50 mL of agar mix
## Steps
1. Add the following to a 500 mL or 1 L bottle (no need to mix) and autoclave:

| Component                | Calculation | Example amounts |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| LB mix (g)               | .025 x V    | 2.5             |
| Bacteriological agar (g) | .015 x V    | 1.5             |
| Milli-Q (mL)             | V           | 100             |

2. Prepare the following while **waiting**:
	1. Warm a **water bath to 60C**. This temperature should not break antibiotics and keep the mix liquid.
	2. Wipe off the plating area with **70% ethanol**.
	3. **Label** each plate with antibiotics that were used, your initials, and data.
3. Once autoclaving is done, stir the mixture, submerge in a water bath, and wait for 5 min for it to cool down (or to re-liquify).
	- You should be able to just hold the bottle in your hand for a few seconds.
4. Light up a **Bunsen burner**.
	- You may also want to wear a face mask.
5. *(Optional)* Add an **appropriate antibiotic** (1 uL of antibiotic per 1 mL of mix).
	- **Swirl** immediately after pouring the antibiotic so that the mix doesn't start gelatinizing locally.
6. *(Optional)* For **blue/white screening**, add 70 ug/mL X-gal and 80 uM IPTG.
7. **Pour the mix to about .5 cm** mark of a plate, immediately covering it.
	- Swirl the mix after pouring each plate to remove bubbles.
	- If the mix starts solidifying in the bottle, re-liquefy it on a low power in a microwave (only when not using antibiotics). Beware of boiling it.
8. Wait ~30-60 min for the mix to **solidify**, then **place under UV for 30 min** with lids open.
	- It might be necessary to wipe off vapor from the lids. Use a paper towel.
9. Test the plates by streaking a resistant strain on one and a non-resistant one on another and incubating overnight.
10. Use in a few days (storing at room temperature) or place in a plastic bag and store at +4C.
