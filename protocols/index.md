# Intro 

## Common protocols used at the Jones!Lab

Treat them as a good starting point for your experiments rather than an authoritative reference. Always think through if they make sense in your situation.

These protocols are always evolving and may be incomplete or contain errors. If you find ways how to improve them, please edit them:

- Easiest: Protocols repository on GitHub – just edit a page right on GitHub, preview changes, and commit. The site will be rebuilt automatically in a few minutes.
- Most convenient: Clone the repository locally and open it with Obsidian. Obsidian makes it easy to update multiple protocols and add images (using Excalidraw plugin).

More protocols are available on the following sites:

- [Barrick lab's protocols](https://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab)
- [Bennett lab wiki](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/BIODESIGN)
- Virtual lab for learning methods: [LabXchange](https://www.labxchange.org/)
