# Cas-gRNA complex formation
Duration: 1 h 40 min + 1h 20 min for gel = 3 h
## Procedure
1. Optionally, heat gRNA samples at 95ºC for 5 minutes and allow to slowly cool to room temperature for the correct secondary structure to form.
2. Prepare 10X NucleaSeq buffer:
	1. 49 uL 10 NucleaSeq buffer (no DTT)
	2. 1 uL 1M DTT
3. Combine a surplus of AsCas12a with gRNA (e.g., twice as much enzyme) in the 1X NucleaSeq buffer.
4. Incubate at 22C ("room temperature") for 30 min.
	- 10 min is likely more than enough.
5. Combine the following components:
	- Proteinase K concentration is likely independent of AsCas12a concentration as there is a huge surplus of Proteinase K.

| Component             | Vol. formula | Example (uL) |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| AsCas12a-gRNA complex | V            | 10           |
| 100 mM EDTA           | V/10         | 1            |
| Proteinase K          | 1            | 1            |

6. Incubate at 55C for 30 min.
	- You can also incubate at 37C for 30 min with no visible difference.
7. Heat inactivate samples at 95C 10 min.
8. To visualize:
	1. Keep samples on ice until loading. 
	2. Run 5 uL of 10 ng (1 pmol) of sample
	3. Gel: 12% Native PAGE
	4. Pre-run: 10 min, 100 V
	5. Run: 60 min, **100 V**
	6. Loading dye: 6X TriTrack, 1 uL
	7. Post-stain: SYBR Gold, 15 min
