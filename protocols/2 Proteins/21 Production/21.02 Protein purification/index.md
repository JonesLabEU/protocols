### Procedure
1. Add **1X** Binding/Wash Buffer to your sample.
	- The sample should be at least 100 nM or so.
	- The manual recommends 700 uL, but you can easily scale it down to 100 uL.
2. **Vortex** Dynabeads for **30 s** to resuspend.
3. Transfer **50 μL** (2 mg) Dynabeads to a microcentrifuge tube and place the tube on a **magnet for 2 min**. **Discard the supernatant.**
	- For small concentrations of the sample (e.g., 100 nM) can go down to 10 uL.
4. **Add your sample** (in the buffer) to beads and pipette up and down.
5. Incubate on a **HulaMixer** for **5 min** at room temperature.
	- Might need 30 min for the incubation to be complete.
	- Can incubate the the cold room if required.
6. Place the tube on the **magnet for 2 min**, then **discard the supernatant**.
7. Wash the beads **4 times** with **300 μL** 1X Binding/Wash Buffer by placing the tube on a **magnet for 2 min** and **discarding the supernatant**.
	- Resuspend the beads thoroughly between each washing step.
	- Can use less of 1X Binding/Wash Buffer
8. Add **100 μL His-Elution Buffer**. Incubate the suspension on a **HulaMixer** for 5 min at room temperature.
	- Might need 30 min for the incubation to be complete.
	- Can incubate the the cold room if required.
9. Apply on the magnet for 2 min and transfer the supernatant containing
the eluted histidine-tagged protein to a clean tube.

## MagStrep® Strep-Tactin®XT beads
Protocol: [Protocol\_MagStrep\_Strep-TactinXT\_Purification.pdf](https://www.iba-lifesciences.com/media/b4/65/7a/1723813819/Protocol_MagStrep_Strep-TactinXT_Purification.pdf)
Tips: [Protein purification with magnetic beads](https://www.iba-lifesciences.com/applications/protein-purification/magnetic-beads-purification)
### Description
- Binding capacity:
	- 42.5 ug/uL = .85 nmol/uL (assuming a 50 kDa protein)
	- For optimal yield, the total bead binding capacity should be around **5 times** the total amount of protein. For example, if the total amount of a 50 kDa protein is 85 μg (= 1.7 nmol), which theoretically could be bound by 2 μl of beads (= 40 uL of 5% suspension), add 5x 2 μl = 10 μl beads = 200 uL of the 5% suspension.
	- For **large proteins** >90 kDa, the binding capacity may decline. To improve the yield of large proteins, **increase the bead volume**. Empirically, 140 kDa proteins were recovered best by **4-6X increase** in the beads volume.
- Beads volume:
	- **1 uL of the beads (=20 uL of the 5% suspension)** should be mixed with a most **2.5 mL of a high-concentration sample** (>1 uM).
	- Decrease the amount of beads up to 3-fold for low protein concentrations (<1 uM)

### Procedure
All steps performed at room temperature

1. **Resuspend** the magnetic beads by pipetting up and down.
2. For every **2.5 μl sample, pipette 1 μl of the 5% beads suspension** into a reaction tube, place it on the **magnetic separator** to separate the beads and **remove the supernatant**.
3. Repeat **3 times**: Resuspend with **500 μl 1x Buffer W**. Separate the beads in the **magnetic separator** and **remove the supernatant**.
4. **Add 250 μl sample** containing the target protein and incubate for **10 minutes**.
	- Keep the beads in suspension by inverting the tube occasionally, or by placing the tube on a roller.
	- Increase incubation time up to 30 min for low bead volumes.
1. Place the reaction tube in the **magnetic separator** and carefully **remove the supernatant**.
2. **Remove tube from the magnet**.
3. Repeat **3 times**: **Resuspend** carefully with **500 μl 1x Buffer W**, place the reaction tube in the **magnetic separator** to collect the beads, and **remove the supernatant**.
4. **Elution** can occur under native or denaturing conditions. Elution under native conditions offers specific elution conditions and thereby higher protein purity.
	1. **Native elution:** Remove the reaction tube from the magnetic separator, resuspend with 125 μl 1x Buffer BXT and incubate for 10 minutes. Place the reaction tube in the magnetic separator and transfer the supernatant containing the target protein into a new reaction tube. Repeat this step once for higher recovery. The first elution step will yield the target protein at the highest concentration.
	2. **Denaturing elution:** Apply conventional **SDS-PAGE sample buffer** and heat the sample to **95 °C for 2 minutes**. Immobilized Strep-Tactin®XT will denature under these conditions and detach from the magnetic beads, leading to an additional band at 13.5 kDa during SDS-PAGE analysis. Strep-Tactin®XT magnetic beads exhibit very low non-specific protein binding activity so that no substantial amounts of other contaminating proteins should be detectable.
5. **Beads regeneration** (optional):
	1. Freshly prepare the **regeneration buffer (0.1 M NaOH)** before use.
	2. **Add** 100 μl of **regeneration buffer** per 1 μl of magnetic beads (or 5 uL per 1 uL of 5% beads suspension).
	3. **Incubate for 2 min** at room temperature.
	4. Place the beads in a **magnetic separator** to separate them and **remove** the supernatant.
	6. Repeat **3 times**: Equilibrate beads in 100 μl **1x Buffer W** per 1 μl beads (or 5 uL per 1 uL of 5% beads suspension), **separate** them in the magnetic separator, and **remove** the **supernatant**.
	8. **Store** the beads in 1x Buffer W at **2-8 °C**.
