# Common techniques
## Liquid handling
### Pipetting
- Make master mixes whenever possible to reduce measurement error, especially when working with small volumes. Add extra 2-4% to be sure you got enough for all your samples.
- Enzymes in 50% glycerol: Do not submerge the pipette tip deep as too much enzyme will be aspirated due to glycerol's viscosity
- Viscous liquids (e.g., glycerol, mineral oil):
	- Pre-wet the tip by pipetting up and down before taking the final amount
	- Can also fully press it to aspirate, then release to the soft press, and discard the rest
- Volatile liquids (e.g., ethanol): Hold the pipette at an angle after aspiring the final amount and work fast as the liquid quickly starts to drip.
- Always watch that all components enter and exit the pipette tip.
### Mixing / vortexing
- Mixing up and down with a pipette: repeat 10 times
- **Vortex and centrifuge tubes before opening**, except for sensitive compounds like enzymes. 
- Enzymes in solutions usually can be vortexed briefly.
### Centrifuging
- Balance your tubes roughly by volume. It need not be perfect: for instance, when balancing spin columns, people often use a different kind of a column as a counterweight (if the correct one is not available, of course).
- For larger centrifuges, balancing is done by weight of the entire thing that you put in the centrifuge, including, for instance, a paper label.
- Do not overfill your tube in such a way that once it is tilted in the centrifuge and there was no cap, the liquid would spill.
### Cooling
- Keep your reagents on ice unless specifically mentioned otherwise.
- Aluminum and water-based Eppendorf racks warm up at about 3-4 deg/min. Thus, if you take something from -20C, in about half an hour your sample will reach 0 deg and in an hour it will be room temperature.
## Concentrations and weights
- Dilutions: Final conc. = Stock conc. x Input vol. / Final vol.
- Concentration in M = Mass (g) / (Molar weight (g/mol) x Volume (L)) 
- 1 uM = 1 pmol/mL
- DNA weight to concentration:
	- Concentration in nM = 1623 x Concentration in ng/uL / Size in bp
- When preparing solutions, first dilute components in a smaller amount of a solvent than the final amount would require, then add to reach the final volume. This is done because the volume may change when solid components dissolve.
## Working with RNA:
- Work at a RNAse-free workstation / laminar hood. 
	- Clean surfaces with RNAse removal spray (e.g., RNAsaZap). But note that residues of RNAseZap might damage RNA, so rinse with RNAse-free water.
	- Sterilize with UV after usage.
	- Autoclaving does not completely eliminate RNAse contamination.
- Protective clothing:
	- Clean lab coat.
	- Fresh gloves (change them after making contact with anything outside of the RNAse-free zone).
	- Face mask (to avoid airborne contamination).
- Samples:
	- Store reagents closed and open them only when needed (to avoid airborne contamination).
	- Store samples with ribonuclease inhibitors to maintain RNA integrity.
